## AI use

### Coding

This project was initially built _before_ the LLM explosion, however, it's now a great place to
explore the capabilities of available models. Some code within the project is authored using
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai).

### Imagery

The majority of the images used in the game are AI generated, most recently using Nano Banana. Image
models used:

- [Flux v1](https://bfl.ai/)
- [Nano banana pro](https://gemini.google.com/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)

### Audio

For now, the audio is stems from royalty free sound effects and music packs from
[Humble Bundle](https://humblebundle.com). These assets are _not_ AI-generated.
